description: Try Kite with test tokens, on a server that can never take real payments.
---

Run a separate server with `KITE_IS_TESTNET=true` and its own database to try Kite without real funds.

- A testnet server only offers testnets when you add a chain; a mainnet server only offers mainnets. Test tokens can never pay a real payment link.
- Switching the flag on an existing database hides the other kind of chains rather than deleting them.
- Everything else works the same: providers, the dashboard, the API, webhooks and the packages.

## Supported testnets

| Network          | Chain ID |
| ---------------- | -------- |
| Base Sepolia     | 84532    |
| Monad Testnet    | 10143    |
| Sepolia          | 11155111 |
| Arbitrum Sepolia | 421614   |
| OP Sepolia       | 11155420 |

As on mainnet, [deploy your own Kite factory](/contracts/overview/#deploying-a-factory) on each testnet you use, with your server's operator wallet as its operator, and set up a deposit notifier and a gas sponsor for each.

## Getting test tokens

On Base Sepolia, Circle's faucet gives test USDC (`0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e`), and most Base Sepolia faucets give test ETH for deploying your factory.
